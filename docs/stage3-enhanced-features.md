**Objective**: Allow users to re-edit existing text objects after creation, changing both content and formatting

**Interaction Methods**:
- **Primary**: Double-click text with Select Tool ‚Üí Opens text editor with current content
- **Secondary**: Click existing text with Text Tool active ‚Üí Opens text editor with current content
- **Optional**: Select text object + press Enter key ‚Üí Opens text editor

**What Can Be Edited**:
- Text content (change the words)
- Text formatting (bold, italic, underline)
- Text color
- All changes save to the same text object ID (no duplication)

**Files to Modify**:

2. In SelectTool: Detect double-click on text objects ‚Üí Trigger edit mode
3. In TextTool: Check if click is on existing text before creating new text
4. If editing existing text:
   - Lock the text object (prevent others from editing)
   - Pre-populate TextEditor with current text, formatting, and color
   - Show TextEditor overlay at text's current position
   - Pass text object ID to TextEditor
5. On save: Update existing text object (use `updateObject` not `createObject`)
6. On cancel: Unlock text object, close editor without changes
7. Ensure ownership/locking prevents conflicts during editing
8. Add keyboard shortcut: Select text + Enter ‚Üí Edit mode

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Double-clicking text with Select Tool opens text editor
- [ ] Clicking existing text with Text Tool opens text editor (not create new)
- [ ] Text editor pre-populates with current text and all formatting
- [ ] Color picker shows current text color
- [ ] Bold/Italic/Underline buttons reflect current formatting state
- [ ] Saving updates the existing text object (verified in Firestore)
- [ ] Canceling leaves text unchanged
- [ ] Text object ID remains the same after editing (no duplication)
- [ ] Ownership/locking works correctly during editing
- [ ] Other users see "locked" indicator while text is being edited
- [ ] Multiple users cannot edit the same text simultaneously

**Testing Steps**:
1. Create text "Hello World" with bold formatting
2. Deselect the text
3. Double-click the text with Select Tool ‚Üí Editor should open with "Hello World" in bold
4. Change text to "Goodbye World" and make it italic instead of bold
5. Save ‚Üí Text should update to "Goodbye World" in italic (not bold)
6. Verify in Firestore that same document ID was updated (not new document created)
7. Test with Text Tool: Click existing text ‚Üí Should edit, not create new text over it
8. Test ownership: User A edits text, User B should see locked indicator and cannot edit
9. Test cancel: Make changes but click cancel ‚Üí Text should remain unchanged
10. Test Enter key shortcut: Select text + press Enter ‚Üí Should open editor

**Edge Cases to Handle**:
- What if user double-clicks while text is being edited by another user? ‚Üí Show "Text is being edited by [User Name]" message
- What if network disconnects during editing? ‚Üí Save to local storage, sync when reconnected
- What if text is rotated? ‚Üí Editor should still appear correctly positioned
- What if text is very long? ‚Üí Editor should handle long text (already supported via TextEditor)

**Dependencies**: 
- Requires E3 (Text Tool with Formatting) ‚úÖ Complete
- Uses existing TextEditor component (should work with pre-populated data)

**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**Implementation Details**:
- Added double-click detection to SelectTool with 300ms threshold
- Added Enter key shortcut in Canvas keyboard handler
- TextEditor component already supported pre-populated data (no changes needed)
- Canvas save logic correctly distinguishes update vs create based on `textEditData.object`
- Text objects are properly locked/unlocked during editing
- Same object ID is updated (no duplication)
- See notes/E10_TEXT_RE_EDITING_COMPLETE.md for full details

2. **Implement Fix/Feature**:
   - Write minimal code to make test pass
   - Run test ‚Üí should pass (green)

3. **Refactor**:
   - Clean up code while keeping tests green
   - Ensure no regressions

4. **Document**:
   - Add comments explaining why test exists
   - Link to bug reports or feature specs

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Vitest installed and configured with coverage reporting
- [ ] Test infrastructure set up (mocks, utilities, fixtures)
- [ ] All critical tools have comprehensive unit tests (90%+ coverage)
- [ ] Geometry/transform utilities fully tested (90%+ coverage)
- [ ] Services and hooks have integration tests (80%+ coverage)
- [ ] Key components have rendering and interaction tests (70%+ coverage)
- [ ] Regression test suite covers all past bugs (E4, star issues, text issues, etc.)
- [ ] GitHub Actions CI runs tests on every PR
- [ ] CI fails if coverage drops below 75% or any test fails
- [ ] TESTING_GUIDE.md documents testing practices and examples
- [ ] Canvas.jsx refactored into smaller, testable components
- [ ] All tests pass consistently (no flaky tests)
- [ ] Test output is clear and helpful when failures occur

**Testing Steps** (to verify testing framework):
1. Run `npm test` ‚Üí All tests pass
2. Run `npm run test:coverage` ‚Üí Coverage meets thresholds (75% overall, 90% critical)
3. Intentionally break a tool ‚Üí Test fails and shows clear error message
4. Fix the tool ‚Üí Test passes again
5. Push to GitHub ‚Üí CI runs and passes
6. Lower coverage ‚Üí CI fails with coverage error
7. Run `npm run test:ui` ‚Üí Visual test interface works
8. Run `npm run test:watch` ‚Üí Watch mode re-runs tests on file changes

**Ongoing Maintenance**:
- Run tests before every commit (`git hooks` optional)
- Review test failures in CI before merging PRs
- Update tests when changing functionality
- Add regression tests for every new bug fix
- Refactor tests as code evolves
- Keep test runtime under 30 seconds for fast feedback

**Success Metrics**:
- 75%+ overall code coverage maintained
- 90%+ coverage on critical paths (tools, geometry, ownership)
- Zero flaky tests (tests pass consistently)
- CI test runs complete in under 2 minutes
- Zero regressions of previously fixed bugs
- New features delivered with tests (TDD)

**Dependencies**: None - this task establishes foundation for future development

**Status**: ‚è∏Ô∏è Not Started

**Deferred to Stage 4**:
- **End-to-End (E2E) Testing** with Playwright/Cypress:
  - Browser automation testing with real user interactions
  - Full user flow testing (login ‚Üí create ‚Üí edit ‚Üí save ‚Üí verify)
  - Visual regression testing (screenshot comparisons)
  - Cross-browser testing
  - Deferred because: E2E tests are slow, flaky, and high-maintenance. Unit/integration tests provide 80% of value with 20% of effort. E2E tests are best added once all features are complete and stable.

### Task E4: Fix Critical Rectangle Resize Bug ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**Objective**: Fix coordinate jumping bug when dragging resize handles past opposite corners

**Files to Modify**:
- `src/components/canvas/Canvas.jsx` (crossover detection logic)
- `src/components/canvas/CanvasObject.jsx` (if needed)

**Specific Changes**:
1. Fix rectangle position jumping when corner handle is dragged past opposite corner
2. Ensure smooth handle role transition (NW becomes SE when dragged past SE corner)
3. Maintain rectangle visibility during crossover (minimum 2x2px at crossover point)
4. Prevent coordinate snapping back to original position during handle transitions
5. Ensure consistent resize behavior in all directions
6. Add visual feedback during crossover operations
7. Test resize operations near canvas boundaries during crossover

**Current Problem**: 
When dragging NW handle past SE corner, rectangle jumps back to original position while handle identity changes, breaking user expectation of smooth interaction.

Drag NW handle past SE ‚Üí handle smoothly becomes SE, rectangle stays at current position (becomes line at crossover), resize continues smoothly.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [x] Rectangle position remains stable during handle crossover operations
- [x] Handle role transitions happen smoothly without position jumping
- [x] Rectangle maintains minimum visibility (2x2px) at exact crossover point
- [x] Resize continues smoothly after crossover in expected direction
- [x] Crossover behavior works consistently for all corner combinations
- [x] No visual artifacts or coordinate jumping during transitions
- [x] Boundary constraints work properly during crossover operations

**Testing Steps**:
1. ‚úÖ Drag NW handle past SE corner and verify smooth transition
2. ‚úÖ Test all corner handle crossover combinations (NW‚ÜîSE, NE‚ÜîSW)
3. ‚úÖ Test crossover behavior near canvas boundaries
4. ‚úÖ Verify resize continues smoothly after crossover
5. ‚úÖ Test with multiple users to ensure sync works during crossover
6. ‚úÖ Verify minimum size constraints work during crossover

**Dependencies**: Requires Task C5 (ownership system) ‚úÖ Complete

**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE - See notes/E4_RESIZE_BUG_FIX.md

### Task A4: Implement Object Deletion

**Objective**: Add ability to delete selected objects using the Delete key, with undo/redo support as safety net

**Dependencies**: 
- Requires A2 (Undo/Redo System) to be implemented first

**Files to Modify**:
- Update `src/components/canvas/Canvas.jsx` (keyboard handler)
- Update `src/services/canvas.service.js` (add deleteObject function)
- Update `src/hooks/useHistory.js` (integrate deletion with undo/redo)

**Specific Changes**:
1. Add Delete/Backspace key handler in Canvas keyboard shortcuts
2. Create `deleteObject()` function in canvas.service.js
3. Delete selected object from Firestore on key press
4. Clear object from RTDB active objects if being dragged
5. Record deletion in undo/redo history for easy recovery
6. Support deleting multiple selected objects at once (if selection system supports it)
7. Respect ownership restrictions - only allow deletion of objects user owns/can edit
8. Provide visual feedback (brief fade-out animation optional)
9. Handle edge cases (offline deletion, concurrent edits, etc.)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Delete key removes selected object immediately
- [ ] Backspace key also works for deletion
- [ ] Deletion respects ownership/locking (can't delete objects being edited by others)
- [ ] Deleted objects can be restored via Undo (Ctrl+Z)
- [ ] Deletion syncs across all users in real-time
- [ ] No warning prompt (undo is the safety net)
- [ ] Multiple selected objects can be deleted at once
- [ ] Deletion works correctly in offline mode (queued and synced on reconnect)

**Testing Steps**:
1. Select object and press Delete key ‚Üí object should disappear
2. Press Ctrl+Z ‚Üí object should reappear (undo)
3. Press Ctrl+Y ‚Üí object should disappear again (redo)
4. Test with Backspace key
5. Test deleting object locked by another user ‚Üí should show error/prevent deletion
6. Test deleting multiple selected objects
7. Test deletion in offline mode ‚Üí should queue and sync on reconnect
8. Test in multiplayer: User A deletes object ‚Üí User B should see it disappear
9. Verify deletion removes object from both Firestore and RTDB

**Edge Cases to Handle**:
- What if object is locked by another user? ‚Üí Show "Cannot delete: object is being edited by [User Name]"
- What if user is offline? ‚Üí Queue deletion, sync when reconnected
- What if object was already deleted by another user? ‚Üí Silently handle (already gone)
- What if undo/redo history is full? ‚Üí Oldest deletion should be forgotten (can't undo anymore)
- What if object has dependencies? ‚Üí For now, no dependencies exist, but design for future extensibility

**Implementation Notes**:
- Use soft delete pattern initially (mark as deleted) vs hard delete
- Consider adding `deletedAt` timestamp for future recovery features
- Integration with undo/redo system is critical - deletion must be recorded as a history action
- Ensure proper cleanup of all references (local state, RTDB, Firestore)

**Status**: ‚è∏Ô∏è Not Started (waiting for A2: Undo/Redo System)

## Next Steps

**Stage 3 Progress: 9/15 tasks complete**

Completed Enhanced Tools:
- ‚úÖ E1: Add Circle Creation Tool
- ‚úÖ E2: Create Properties Display in Toolbar
- ‚úÖ E3: Implement Text Tool with Basic Formatting
- ‚úÖ E4: Fix Critical Rectangle Resize Bug
- ‚úÖ E6: Implement Object Rotation Tool
- ‚úÖ E7: Add Star Shape Tool
- ‚úÖ E8: Add Color Picker for Shapes
- ‚úÖ E9: Implement Z-Index Management
- ‚úÖ E10: Enable Continuous Text Editing (Re-edit Existing Text)

Remaining Enhanced Tools:
- ‚è∏Ô∏è E5: Add Owner-Only Edit Restrictions
- ‚è∏Ô∏è E11: Comprehensive Testing Framework (Unit, Integration, Regression)

Remaining Advanced Features:
- ‚è∏Ô∏è A1: Implement Canvas Export Functionality
- ‚è∏Ô∏è A2: Add Undo/Redo System
- ‚è∏Ô∏è A3: Enhance Toolbar Design
- ‚è∏Ô∏è A4: Implement Object Deletion (depends on A2)

Deferred (moved to end or separate stage):
- ‚ùå A0: Performance Optimization & Monitoring

**Recommended Order**:
1. **E11 (Testing Framework)** - Establish testing infrastructure and prevent future regressions ‚Üê **DOING NOW**
2. **E5 (Ownership UI)** - Visual ownership indicators and edit restrictions
3. **A2 (Undo/Redo System)** - Critical safety net for destructive operations
4. **A4 (Object Deletion)** - Delete key functionality (safe with undo/redo)
5. **A1 (Canvas Export)** - PNG/SVG export functionality
6. **A3 (Toolbar Design)** - Visual polish and refinement
7. **A0 (Performance)** - Optimization and monitoring (deferred to end)

**Why E11 First?**
- Establishes testing foundation to prevent regressions going forward
- Creates safety net before implementing complex features (E5, A2, A4)
- Enables Test-Driven Development (TDD) for all future work
- Catches bugs early and reduces debugging time
- Critical for maintaining code quality as codebase grows
- Should have been implemented from the beginning, doing it now before more complexity is added

**Why E5 Next (After E11)?**
- Completes all Enhanced Tools (E1-E11)
- Visual ownership indicators improve collaborative UX
- Edit restrictions prevent conflicts in multi-user scenarios
- Foundation for safe deletion (A4) - users need to know who owns what before deleting
- Relatively contained scope (visual indicators + interaction blocking)
- Can be developed with TDD using new testing framework

**Why A2 Before A4?**
- Undo/Redo is the safety net for deletion
- Without undo, accidental deletions are permanent (bad UX)
- A4 explicitly depends on A2 per user requirements

**Why A0 Deferred?**
- Current performance is acceptable for typical use cases
- Optimization is best done after all features are complete
- Can be moved to Stage 4 or addressed as needed
- Not blocking any other features

After completing Stage 3, proceed to **Stage 4: Production Ready** tasks for deployment preparation.
