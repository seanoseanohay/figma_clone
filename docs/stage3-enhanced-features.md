### Task E10: Enable Continuous Text Editing (Re-edit Existing Text)

**Objective**: Allow users to re-edit existing text objects after creation, changing both content and formatting

**Interaction Methods**:
- **Primary**: Double-click text with Select Tool ‚Üí Opens text editor with current content
- **Secondary**: Click existing text with Text Tool active ‚Üí Opens text editor with current content
- **Optional**: Select text object + press Enter key ‚Üí Opens text editor

**What Can Be Edited**:
- Text content (change the words)
- Text formatting (bold, italic, underline)
- Text color
- All changes save to the same text object ID (no duplication)

**Files to Modify**:
- Update `src/tools/TextTool.js` - Detect clicks on existing text vs empty canvas
- Update `src/tools/SelectTool.js` - Add double-click event handler
- Update `src/components/canvas/Canvas.jsx` - Handle double-click detection and edit mode trigger
- Update `src/components/canvas/TextEditor.jsx` - Ensure it works with pre-populated data (likely already works)

**Specific Changes**:
1. Add double-click event listener to Canvas component
2. In SelectTool: Detect double-click on text objects ‚Üí Trigger edit mode
3. In TextTool: Check if click is on existing text before creating new text
4. If editing existing text:
   - Lock the text object (prevent others from editing)
   - Pre-populate TextEditor with current text, formatting, and color
   - Show TextEditor overlay at text's current position
   - Pass text object ID to TextEditor
5. On save: Update existing text object (use `updateObject` not `createObject`)
6. On cancel: Unlock text object, close editor without changes
7. Ensure ownership/locking prevents conflicts during editing
8. Add keyboard shortcut: Select text + Enter ‚Üí Edit mode

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Double-clicking text with Select Tool opens text editor
- [ ] Clicking existing text with Text Tool opens text editor (not create new)
- [ ] Text editor pre-populates with current text and all formatting
- [ ] Color picker shows current text color
- [ ] Bold/Italic/Underline buttons reflect current formatting state
- [ ] Saving updates the existing text object (verified in Firestore)
- [ ] Canceling leaves text unchanged
- [ ] Text object ID remains the same after editing (no duplication)
- [ ] Ownership/locking works correctly during editing
- [ ] Other users see "locked" indicator while text is being edited
- [ ] Multiple users cannot edit the same text simultaneously

**Testing Steps**:
1. Create text "Hello World" with bold formatting
2. Deselect the text
3. Double-click the text with Select Tool ‚Üí Editor should open with "Hello World" in bold
4. Change text to "Goodbye World" and make it italic instead of bold
5. Save ‚Üí Text should update to "Goodbye World" in italic (not bold)
6. Verify in Firestore that same document ID was updated (not new document created)
7. Test with Text Tool: Click existing text ‚Üí Should edit, not create new text over it
8. Test ownership: User A edits text, User B should see locked indicator and cannot edit
9. Test cancel: Make changes but click cancel ‚Üí Text should remain unchanged
10. Test Enter key shortcut: Select text + press Enter ‚Üí Should open editor

**Edge Cases to Handle**:
- What if user double-clicks while text is being edited by another user? ‚Üí Show "Text is being edited by [User Name]" message
- What if network disconnects during editing? ‚Üí Save to local storage, sync when reconnected
- What if text is rotated? ‚Üí Editor should still appear correctly positioned
- What if text is very long? ‚Üí Editor should handle long text (already supported via TextEditor)

**Dependencies**: 
- Requires E3 (Text Tool with Formatting) ‚úÖ Complete
- Uses existing TextEditor component (should work with pre-populated data)

**Status**: ‚è∏Ô∏è NOT STARTED

**Implementation Notes**:
- TextEditor.jsx likely already supports pre-populated data through `initialText` and `initialFormatting` props
- Main work is in detecting double-click and existing text clicks
- Need to pass additional prop to TextEditor: `textObjectId` (null for new text, ID for editing)
- In Canvas.jsx onSave callback: Check if `textObjectId` exists ‚Üí `updateObject()` vs `createObject()`
