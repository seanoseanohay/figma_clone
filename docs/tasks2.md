## üìã Overview
This project enhances the CollabCanvas MVP with improved UI, project management, canvas refactoring, and **REST API for AI agent access**. Tasks are organized into 5 development stages for better manageability.

**New in this version**: REST API infrastructure (Tasks C7-C9) enables AI agents and external applications to programmatically manipulate canvases via HTTP endpoints with token-based authentication.

---

## üìñ Stage Summaries

### Stage 1: Foundation (‚úÖ Complete)
Core UI and infrastructure improvements that everything else builds upon.
- Google-only authentication
- Redesigned header with project/canvas dropdown
- Project/canvas data models and services
- Canvas-scoped presence system foundation

### Stage 2: Core Functionality (üîÑ In Progress)
Primary features that extend the platform.
- Project and canvas management system ‚úÖ
- Canvas-scoped presence ‚úÖ
- Canvas sharing with simplified permissions (NEXT)
- Connection status monitoring and retry logic
- Tool handler extraction and refactoring
- Central ownership management
- REST API infrastructure for AI agents
- API token management system
- Comprehensive API documentation

### Stage 3: Enhanced Features (‚è∏Ô∏è Not Started)
New tools and advanced features for polished UX.
- **Enhanced Tools**: Circle tool, properties sidebar, text tool, resize bug fixes, owner-only restrictions
- **Advanced Features**: Performance optimization, canvas export, undo/redo, toolbar redesign

### Stage 4: Production Ready (‚è∏Ô∏è Not Started)
Deployment preparation and production reliability.
- UI polish and comprehensive error handling
- Firebase quota management and monitoring
- Final deployment with complete documentation

### Stage 5: Future Work (‚è∏Ô∏è Not Started)
Post-MVP improvements and advanced collaboration.
- Mobile navigation with hamburger menu
- Recently used sorting
- Theme selector (light/dark mode)
- Grid system with snap-to-grid
- Advanced ownership system (30-second timeout)
- 24-color cursor palette
- Intentional deletion system
- Multi-select functionality
- Performance and scalability improvements
- Accessibility features

## üîî Key Implementation Notes

### Architecture Highlights
- **Canvas-Scoped Presence**: Production uses `/projects/{projectId}/canvases/{canvasId}/presence/{userId}` (MVP's global canvas is deprecated)
- **Simplified Permissions**: All collaborators have equal edit permissions (no viewer role)
- **REST API for AI**: Tasks C7-C9 enable programmatic canvas manipulation via Cloud Functions
- **Token-Based Access**: AI agents use canvas-scoped tokens with rate limiting (200 reads/min, 50 writes/min)

### Critical Path
1. **Stage 1** (Foundation) ‚Üí ‚úÖ Complete
2. **Stage 2** (Core) ‚Üí Complete C2 (sharing) next, then C3-C5, then C7-C9 for API
3. **Stage 3** (Enhanced) ‚Üí Start after Stage 2 completion
4. **Stage 4** (Production) ‚Üí Required before deployment
5. **Stage 5** (Future) ‚Üí Post-deployment enhancements

**‚ö†Ô∏è Do not skip stages** - each builds on the previous with explicit dependencies.

## üìù Additional Resources

### Implementation Guidelines
- **Code Quality**: Follow existing patterns, add comprehensive error handling, write clear code
- **Testing**: Test manually after each task, verify collaborative editing works, test responsive behavior
- **Canvas Testing**: After ANY changes, verify canvas page still renders and works correctly (per user rules)
- **Documentation**: Update progress docs, document architectural decisions

### Migration Notes
**MVP ‚Üí Production**: The MVP used a global canvas at `/globalCanvas/users/{userId}`. Production now uses canvas-scoped presence at `/projects/{projectId}/canvases/{canvasId}/presence/{userId}`. All references to "global canvas" are deprecated.
