## ‚ùå Not Started Tasks

### High Priority (Should complete next)

**C6: Implement Canvas-Scoped Presence System** üî• **CRITICAL**
- Currently using GLOBAL presence (all users see each other regardless of canvas)
- Blocks: F2 completion, C2 (sharing), proper multi-canvas collaboration
- Required before: Most other tasks that depend on proper presence

**C2: Implement Canvas Sharing**
- Depends on: C1 ‚úÖ (complete), F4 ‚úÖ (complete)
- Need to create: ShareCanvasModal component
- Update: project.service.js with sharing functions

**C4: Extract Canvas Tool Handlers**
- No `/tools` directory exists yet
- Need to create: MoveTool.js, ResizeTool.js, RectangleTool.js, PanTool.js
- Will significantly reduce Canvas.jsx complexity

**C5: Implement Central Ownership Management**
- Currently using lockObject/unlockObject
- Need: useObjectOwnership hook
- 10-second auto-release timer system
- Visual ownership indicators

### Lower Priority

- **C7-C9:** REST API Infrastructure (for AI agents)
- **E1-E5:** Enhanced Tools (Circle, Properties Panel, Text, Bug Fixes)
- **A0-A3:** Advanced Features (Performance, Export, Undo/Redo, Toolbar Design)
- **PR1-PR3:** Production Ready (UI Polish, Firebase Quota Management, Deployment)
- **FE1+:** Future Enhancements
- **P1-P5:** Post-MVP Phase 1 & 2 (Advanced collaboration)

## Current Architecture Notes

### Presence System (‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS FIXING)
**Current state:** Using global presence at `/globalCanvas/users/{userId}`
- All users see each other regardless of which canvas they're viewing
- NOT suitable for production with multiple canvases

**Target state:** Canvas-scoped presence at `/projects/{projectId}/canvases/{canvasId}/presence/{userId}`
- Users only see others on the same canvas
- Proper multi-canvas isolation

**Files using global presence:**
- `src/hooks/usePresence.js` - subscribes to global presence
- `src/hooks/useCursorTracking.js` - broadcasts to global presence
- `src/services/presence.service.js` - implements global presence
- `src/components/layout/Header.jsx` - shows global users

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Complete C6: Canvas-Scoped Presence** (CRITICAL)
   - Required for proper multi-canvas functionality
   - Unblocks F2 and C2
   - Estimated: 4-6 hours
   - Impact: High - fixes fundamental architecture issue

2. **Complete C2: Canvas Sharing**
   - Now that C1 is done, sharing can be implemented
   - Estimated: 2-3 hours
   - Impact: High - enables collaboration

3. **Complete F2: Add Share Button to Header**
   - Quick win after C2 is done
   - Estimated: 30 minutes
   - Impact: Medium - completes header functionality

4. **Complete C3: Connection Status Monitoring**
   - Half done already
   - Estimated: 2-3 hours
   - Impact: Medium - improves reliability

5. **Complete C4: Extract Tool Handlers**
   - Important for maintainability
   - Estimated: 3-4 hours
   - Impact: Medium - code quality

6. **Complete C5: Ownership Management**
   - Currently using basic lock system
   - Estimated: 3-4 hours
   - Impact: High - better collaboration

## Critical Issues to Address

### 1. Global Presence Architecture (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Issue:** Currently all users appear in each other's presence regardless of which canvas they're on.

**Impact:** 
- Users on "Canvas A" see users on "Canvas B"
- Violates multi-canvas isolation
- Confusing user experience

**Solution:** Implement Task C6 immediately

### 2. No Canvas Sharing Yet
**Issue:** Users cannot invite collaborators to canvases.

**Impact:** 
- Limited collaboration
- Header "Share" button missing

**Solution:** Implement Task C2

### 3. No Offline Editing Prevention
**Issue:** Users can attempt edits when offline, causing confusion.

**Impact:** 
- Failed operations
- Poor user experience
- Potential data loss

**Solution:** Complete Task C3

---

## Conclusion

Good progress has been made on foundational infrastructure (authentication, data models, project management). The immediate priority should be **Task C6 (Canvas-Scoped Presence)** as it's a critical architectural requirement that blocks multiple other features. Once C6 is complete, the project can proceed with sharing functionality (C2) and complete the header design (F2).

The codebase is well-structured with good separation of concerns. The project.service.js and useProjects hook are particularly well-implemented with caching, error handling, and extensibility in mind.
