# Task C6: Canvas-Scoped Presence System - Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Date**: October 16, 2025  
**Task**: C6 - Implement Canvas-Scoped Presence System  
**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Status**: 100% Complete

---

## üéØ Objective Achieved

Successfully migrated from MVP global canvas presence to production canvas-scoped presence. Users now only see cursors and user lists for others on the **exact same project+canvas combination**.

---

## üì¶ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Canvas Context System** ‚úÖ
Created a robust context system to track the current canvas:

**Files Created:**
- `src/contexts/CanvasContext.jsx` - Context provider with localStorage persistence
- `src/hooks/useCanvas.js` - Hook to access canvas context

**Features:**
- Tracks current `projectId` and `canvasId`
- Syncs with URL params automatically
- Persists to localStorage (survives refresh)
- Provides `setCurrentCanvas()`, `getCurrentCanvas()`, `clearCurrentCanvas()`

### 2. **Presence Service Overhaul** ‚úÖ
Completely refactored presence system for canvas scoping:

**File Modified:**
- `src/services/presence.service.js`

**Changes:**
- **Old Path**: `/globalCanvas/users/{userId}` (MVP - DEPRECATED)
- **New Path**: `/projects/{projectId}/canvases/{canvasId}/presence/{userId}`
- Added `getUserCursorColor()` for consistent color assignment
- Updated all functions to require `projectId` and `canvasId` parameters:
  - `updateCursorPosition(projectId, canvasId, x, y)`
  - `setUserOnline(projectId, canvasId, userData)`
  - `setUserOffline(projectId, canvasId)`
  - `subscribeToCanvasPresence(projectId, canvasId, callback)`

**New Presence Data Structure:**
```javascript
{
  userId: string,
  displayName: string,
  email: string,
  cursorColor: string,    // NEW: Deterministic color
  cursorX: number,         // CHANGED: Separate fields
  cursorY: number,         // CHANGED: Separate fields
  lastActive: timestamp,   // CHANGED: From lastSeen
  connectedAt: timestamp   // CHANGED: From joinedAt
}
```

### 3. **Hooks Updated** ‚úÖ
Integrated canvas context into presence hooks:

**Files Modified:**
- `src/hooks/useCursorTracking.js`
- `src/hooks/usePresence.js`

**useCursorTracking Changes:**
- Now uses `useCanvas()` hook to get current canvas
- Only tracks cursor when canvas is selected
- Automatically cleans up presence when switching canvases
- Prevents cursor updates when no canvas active

**usePresence Changes:**
- Subscribes to canvas-scoped presence only
- Unsubscribes and resubscribes when canvas changes
- Returns empty array when no canvas selected
- Filters users by canvas automatically

### 4. **UI Components Updated** ‚úÖ
Updated all presence-related components:

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/canvas/UserCursor.jsx`
- `src/components/presence/OnlineUsers.jsx`
- `src/components/layout/Header.jsx`

**UserCursor Changes:**
- Uses `cursorX`/`cursorY` instead of `cursorPosition` object
- Uses `userId` instead of `uid`
- Uses `cursorColor` from presence data

**OnlineUsers Changes:**
- Shows "No canvas selected" when no canvas active
- Displays canvas ID in debug info
- Shows "(on this canvas)" label
- Uses `userId` and canvas-scoped data

**Header Changes:**
- User squares show only canvas-specific users
- Uses `cursorColor` from presence data when available
- Uses `userId` for canvas-scoped users
- Consistent with presence service color algorithm

### 5. **Security Rules Updated** ‚úÖ
Implemented canvas-scoped security:

**File Modified:**
- `database.rules.json`

**New Rules:**
```json
{
  "rules": {
    "projects": {
      "$projectId": {
        "canvases": {
          "$canvasId": {
            "presence": {
              ".read": "auth != null",
              ".write": false,
              "$userId": {
                ".read": "auth != null",
                ".write": "auth != null && auth.uid == $userId",
                ".validate": "auth != null && newData.child('userId').val() == auth.uid"
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Security Features:**
- Users can only write their own presence
- Presence is scoped per canvas
- Validates userId matches auth.uid

### 6. **App Integration** ‚úÖ
Integrated canvas context throughout the app:

**File Modified:**
- `src/App.jsx`

**Changes:**
- Wrapped routes with `<CanvasProvider>`
- Context available to all protected routes
- Supports both URL formats:
  - `/project/{projectId}/canvas/{canvasId}`
  - `/canvas/{canvasId}` (legacy support)

### 7. **Constants Cleanup** ‚úÖ
Removed deprecated global canvas references:

**File Modified:**
- `src/constants/canvas.constants.js`

**Changes:**
- Removed `GLOBAL_CANVAS` from `FIREBASE_COLLECTIONS`
- Deprecated `REALTIME_PATHS.GLOBAL_PRESENCE`
- Added documentation about canvas-scoped paths
- Added `PROJECTS` to Firebase collections
