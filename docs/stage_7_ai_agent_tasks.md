1. Broadcast AI mutations via presence events.  
2. Prevent conflicts with manual edits.  
3. Show “AI is editing…” status indicator.  

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- [ ] All users see AI changes within 1 s.  
- [ ] No data collisions.  

---

### Task AIA6: Agent Metrics & Feedback
**Objective:**  
Measure latency, accuracy, and success rates.

**Files to Create:**  
- `src/hooks/useAgentMetrics.js`  
- `src/components/ai/AgentMetricsPanel.jsx`

**Specific Changes:**  
1. Track start → response time.  
2. Log success/failure per command.  
3. Display rolling stats in sidebar.  

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- [ ] Metrics update live.  
- [ ] Logs persist in dev mode.
