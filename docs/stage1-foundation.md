## Task F4: Set Up Canvas Data Models ✅ COMPLETE

**Objective**: Create Firebase data structure for canvases with collaboration and invitation system

**Files Created**:
- `src/services/project.service.js` (for backend-only project management)
- `src/hooks/useCanvases.js`

**Files Modified**:
- `src/services/canvas.service.js`
- `src/services/auth.service.js`
- Firebase security rules

**Data Structure Implemented**:
```
canvases/{canvasId}:
  - projectId, ownerId, createdBy, name, collaborators[], createdAt

projects/{projectId}:
  - name, ownerId, collaborators[], autoGenerated, createdAt
  (Backend only - projectId equals canvasId for auto-generated projects)

canvasObjects/{objectId}:
  - canvasId, type, x, y, width, height, fill, etc.

pendingInvites/{inviteId}:
  - canvasId, canvasName, inviteeEmail, invitedBy, invitedByEmail, createdAt, expiresAt

presence (Realtime Database):
  /canvases/{canvasId}/presence/{userId}:
    - userId, displayName, email, cursorColor, cursorX, cursorY, lastActive, connectedAt
```

**Functions Implemented**:
- getCanvasesForUser (queries by ownerId and collaborators array)
- addCollaboratorToCanvas (with pending invite system)
- deleteCanvas (deletes canvas, project, and all objects)
- createCanvas (auto-generates matching project)
- processPendingInvites (called on user login)
- Firebase security rules for canvas-based access control
- Data validation for required fields
- Permission checking helpers

**Status**: ✅ Complete

## Next Steps

Proceed to **Stage 2: Core Functionality** tasks (C1-C9).

**Note**: Canvas-scoped presence (C6) is already complete as part of recent development efforts.
