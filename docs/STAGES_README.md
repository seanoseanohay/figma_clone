# CollabCanvas Development Stages

## Overview

The CollabCanvas project has been organized into 5 development stages for better task management and clarity. This document provides an overview of each stage and guides you through the development process.

- **Status**: Not started
- **Tasks**: 5 enhanced tools (E1-E5) + 4 advanced features (A0-A3)
- **Key Deliverables**: Circle tool, properties sidebar, text tool, performance optimization, export, undo/redo

### [Stage 4: Production Ready](./stage4-production-ready.md) ‚è∏Ô∏è **NOT STARTED**
Deployment preparation, reliability, and production-level polish.
- **Status**: Not started
- **Tasks**: 3 production tasks (PR1-PR3)
- **Key Deliverables**: Error handling, Firebase quota management, deployment & documentation

### [Stage 5: Future Work](./stage5-future-work.md) ‚è∏Ô∏è **NOT STARTED**
Post-MVP improvements, advanced collaboration, and long-term optimizations.
- **Status**: Not started
- **Tasks**: 4 future enhancements (FE1-FE4) + 5 post-MVP phase 1 (P2-P5) + 3 post-MVP phase 2 (P2-1 to P2-3) + 2 future optimizations (FO0-FO1)
- **Key Deliverables**: Mobile menu, theme selector, advanced ownership, multi-select, accessibility

## üéØ Current Status (October 16, 2025)

### Completed Stages
- ‚úÖ **Stage 1**: Foundation - All 4 tasks complete

### Active Stage
- üîÑ **Stage 2**: Core Functionality - 2 of 9 tasks complete
  - ‚úÖ C1: Project/Canvas Management System
  - üîÑ C3: Connection Status Monitoring (40% complete)
  - ‚úÖ C6: Canvas-Scoped Presence
  - **NEXT**: C2 - Canvas Sharing

### Upcoming Stages
- ‚è∏Ô∏è **Stage 3**: Enhanced Features - Start after Stage 2
- ‚è∏Ô∏è **Stage 4**: Production Ready - Start after Stage 3
- ‚è∏Ô∏è **Stage 5**: Future Work - Start after production deployment

## üìà Development Path

### Immediate Priorities (Next 2-4 weeks)
1. **Complete C2** (Canvas Sharing) - NEXT
2. **Complete C3** (Connection Status - edit prevention & retry)
3. **Consider C4-C5** (Tool refactoring & ownership)
4. **Plan C7-C9** (REST API for AI agents)

### Short-term Goals (1-2 months)
- Complete all Stage 2 tasks (Core Functionality)
- Begin Stage 3 tasks (Enhanced Features)
- Focus on performance optimization (A0)

### Medium-term Goals (2-4 months)
- Complete Stage 3 (Enhanced Features)
- Complete Stage 4 (Production Ready)
- Deploy production version

### Long-term Goals (4+ months)
- Iterate on Stage 5 based on user feedback
- Scale infrastructure as needed
- Add advanced collaboration features

## üîë Key Architectural Decisions

### Canvas-Scoped Presence (Completed)
The MVP used a global canvas where all users appeared together. **Production now uses canvas-scoped presence** where users only see others on the same project+canvas. This is the foundation for all future collaboration features.

**Path**: `/projects/{projectId}/canvases/{canvasId}/presence/{userId}`

### Simplified Permission Model
- **No Viewer role**: All collaborators have equal edit permissions
- **Canvas-scoped access**: Users only see/access canvases they're invited to
- **Token-based API access**: External apps and AI use tokens, not user accounts

### REST API for AI Agents
Tasks C7-C9 provide REST API infrastructure enabling AI agents (Claude, GPT-4, etc.) to programmatically manipulate canvases via HTTP endpoints with token-based authentication.

## üõ†Ô∏è Working with Stages

### Starting a New Task
1. Review the current stage document
2. Check task dependencies
3. Read acceptance criteria and testing steps
4. Begin implementation
5. Test thoroughly before marking complete

### Completing a Task
1. Verify all acceptance criteria are met
2. Complete all testing steps
3. Update task status in stage document
4. Document any architectural decisions
5. Commit changes with clear messages

### Moving Between Stages
- **Do not skip stages** - each builds on the previous
- Complete majority of current stage before moving to next
- Some parallel work is acceptable (e.g., C3 + C2)
- Always maintain working state

## üí° Tips for Success

1. **Follow the order**: Stages are sequenced for a reason - dependencies matter
2. **Test thoroughly**: Each task has specific testing requirements
3. **Document as you go**: Update progress and architectural decisions
4. **Maintain quality**: Don't skip error handling or edge cases
5. **Think ahead**: Build expandable architecture for future features
6. **Canvas testing**: After ANY changes, verify canvas page still works (see user rules)

---

## üé≠ Testing Philosophy

Per user requirements, after making ANY changes that could affect the canvas page:
1. Verify the canvas page still renders correctly
2. Check that all interactive elements work
3. Test any animations or visual effects
4. Confirm no console errors appear

**Always end with a Norm Macdonald style one-liner when completing work.**
