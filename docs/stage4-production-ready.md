   - Reduce real-time sync frequency during high load periods
   - Show "High Traffic - Reduced Performance" message to users

3. **Firebase Alerts Configuration** (External Setup):
   - Document setup for Firebase Console alerts at 80% of limits
   - Create monitoring dashboards for usage tracking
   - Document upgrade path to Firebase Blaze plan
   - Add usage forecasting based on user growth

4. **Alternative Sync Strategies** (Stretch Goal):
   - Design WebSocket fallback for cursor updates if RT DB quota exceeded
   - Implement peer-to-peer cursor sharing for high-traffic scenarios
   - Keep object sync on Firestore, fallback cursors to alternative method
   - Add intelligent load balancing between sync methods

5. **User Communication System**:
   - Add quota status display for administrators
   - Show performance mode indicators to users
   - Implement graceful service degradation messages
   - Add estimated restoration time for full performance

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Firebase usage is accurately monitored and logged
- [ ] System gracefully degrades performance when approaching quotas
- [ ] Users receive clear communication about performance changes
- [ ] Administrators can monitor usage and plan upgrades
- [ ] Fallback systems activate smoothly without service interruption
- [ ] Usage forecasting helps predict scaling needs

**Testing Steps**:

1. **Quota Monitoring Testing**:
   - Simulate high usage scenarios and verify monitoring accuracy
   - Test quota warning thresholds and alert systems
   - Verify usage tracking across different Firebase services

2. **Degradation Testing**:
   - Test performance reduction during simulated high load
   - Verify user communication during degraded performance
   - Test restoration to full performance when load decreases

3. **Scalability Testing**:
   - Test system behavior near Firebase free tier limits
   - Verify alternative sync methods if implemented
