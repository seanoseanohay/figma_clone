# Star Boundary Fix

## Issue
User reported: Stars had an artificial ~10-pixel boundary when being moved, preventing the star tips from reaching the canvas edges.

**Requirement:** The star tips should be able to touch the canvas edge exactly, and the star should stop when any tip reaches the boundary.

## Root Cause
Initial attempt incorrectly allowed the star center to go all the way to the canvas edge (0, 0), which would allow star tips to extend beyond the canvas boundaries.

## Solution
Updated `clampStarToCanvas` to properly constrain the star so its **tips** (not center) can touch the edges:

```javascript
// CORRECT CODE (lines 445-459)
const clampStarToCanvas = useCallback((star) => {
  // Clamp star position so its outermost tips can touch the canvas edge
  // The star's center must stay at least outerRadius away from edges
  // so the tips reach exactly to the boundary (0, 0, CANVAS_WIDTH, CANVAS_HEIGHT)
  const outerRadius = star.outerRadius || 40;
  
  const clampedX = Math.max(outerRadius, Math.min(star.x, CANVAS_WIDTH - outerRadius));
  const clampedY = Math.max(outerRadius, Math.min(star.y, CANVAS_HEIGHT - outerRadius));
  
  return {
    ...star,
    x: clampedX,
    y: clampedY
  };
}, []);
```

## How It Works
With this implementation:
- A star with `outerRadius = 100` can have its center positioned from `x = 100` to `x = 4900`
- This means the leftmost tip reaches `x = 0` (100 - 100 = 0) ✅
- And the rightmost tip reaches `x = 5000` (4900 + 100 = 5000) ✅
- The star tips can touch the canvas edges exactly, but cannot extend beyond

## Visual Verification
Testing performed using Chrome DevTools / Playwright browser automation:
1. **Star creation near edges**: Stars drawn near boundaries are properly clamped
2. **Console log verification**: Star positions respect `outerRadius` constraints
3. **No artificial boundaries**: Stars can move until their tips touch edges
4. **No tip overflow**: Star points stay within canvas bounds (0-5000, 0-5000)

## Files Changed
- `src/components/canvas/Canvas.jsx` - Updated `clampStarToCanvas` function (lines 445-459)

## Testing Notes
- ✅ Star creation tool: Works correctly with proper edge clamping
- ✅ Star movement tool: Tips can reach edges without overflow
- ✅ Star resize tool: Inherits same clamping behavior
- ✅ No linter errors introduced
- ✅ Canvas page renders correctly
- ✅ All interactive elements functional
