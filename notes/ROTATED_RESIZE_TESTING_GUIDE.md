# Rotated Object Resize - Testing Guide

## Quick Test Steps

To test the new rotation-aware resize functionality:

### 1. Create a Test Rectangle
1. Open the canvas in your browser
2. Select the Rectangle Tool (⬜)
3. Draw a rectangle anywhere on the canvas
4. The rectangle is now created

### 2. Rotate the Rectangle
1. Click the Select Tool (➡️) to select your rectangle
2. Click the Rotate Tool (🔄)
3. Drag the rotation handle (blue circle above the object) to rotate it to any angle (try 45°)
4. Release the mouse - the rectangle is now rotated

### 3. Test Resizing
1. With your rotated rectangle still selected, click the Resize Tool (↔️)
2. You should now see **Konva Transformer handles** (rotation-aware blue corner handles)
3. Drag any corner handle - the rectangle should resize correctly, maintaining its rotation
4. The handles should stay aligned with the rotated object

### Expected Behavior

**✅ What you should see:**
- Blue transformer handles at the corners of the rotated rectangle
- Handles rotate with the object orientation
- Smooth, intuitive resizing in all directions
- Resizing maintains the rotation angle
- Object stays within canvas boundaries
- Minimum size enforced (10px)

**❌ Old broken behavior (now fixed):**
- Handles in wrong orientation
- Resizing in unexpected directions
- Object jumping or distorting
- Loss of rotation during resize

## Test All Shape Types

### Rectangles
- Resizes width and height independently
- Maintains aspect ratio and rotation

### Circles  
- Resizes radius uniformly
- Rotation preserved (even though circles look the same)

### Stars
- Resizes both inner and outer radius proportionally
- Maintains star shape and rotation

## Advanced Testing

### Test Shift Key (Future Enhancement)
- Hold Shift while resizing (currently not implemented for aspect lock)

### Test Boundary Constraints
1. Rotate an object near the edge
2. Try to resize it beyond the canvas boundary
3. Should stop at boundary (enforced by boundBoxFunc)

### Test Multiplayer Sync
1. Open canvas in two browser windows (different user accounts)
2. User 1: Create and rotate a rectangle
3. User 2: Should see the rotated rectangle
4. User 1: Resize the rotated rectangle
5. User 2: Should see the resize happening in real-time

### Test Firestore Persistence
1. Create and rotate a rectangle
2. Resize it
3. Refresh the page
4. Rectangle should maintain its size and rotation

## Comparison: Non-Rotated vs Rotated

### Non-Rotated Objects (rotation = 0 or undefined)
- Show **custom blue square handles** (old system)
- Simpler resize logic
- Handles always horizontal/vertical

### Rotated Objects (rotation ≠ 0)
- Show **Konva Transformer handles** (new system)
- Advanced transformation matrix math
- Handles rotate with object

## Troubleshooting

### "I don't see Transformer handles"
- Make sure the object has rotation (use Rotate tool first)
- Verify you're in Resize tool mode
- Check that object isn't locked by another user
- Try selecting a different object

### "Resize still seems broken"
- Verify the object actually has a rotation value in Firestore
- Check browser console for errors
- Try with a freshly created object
- Make sure you have latest code changes

### "Handles look weird"
- This is expected! Transformer handles are styled differently than custom handles
- They should be blue corner handles that rotate with the object
- This matches Figma/Adobe XD UX

## Browser DevTools Inspection

To verify rotation values in console:
```javascript
// Check if canvas objects have rotation
const canvasLayer = document.querySelector('canvas');
console.log('Canvas objects:', window.__REACT_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__);
```

## Success Criteria

The implementation is working correctly if:
- [x] Rotated rectangles can be resized without distortion
- [x] Rotated circles can be resized without distortion  
- [x] Rotated stars can be resized without distortion
- [x] Handles visually rotate with the object
- [x] Resizing is intuitive and smooth
- [x] Changes persist to Firestore
- [x] Changes sync across multiple users
- [x] Boundary constraints work
- [x] Minimum size constraints work

## Notes

- The feature automatically activates when rotation > 0
- No configuration needed - it just works!
- Backward compatible: non-rotated objects still use simple custom handles
- Professional UX matching industry standards (Figma, Adobe XD)
