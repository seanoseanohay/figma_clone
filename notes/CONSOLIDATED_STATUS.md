- Identifies bottlenecks early
- Ensures smooth experience as features are added
- Provides metrics to validate future optimizations

**What it includes**:
- Konva layer caching
- Cursor update optimization
- Object position update batching
- FPS monitoring dashboard
- Memory usage tracking

Add new capabilities to the canvas:
- **E2**: Properties Sidebar - Inspect/edit object properties (position, size, color)
- **E3**: Text Tool - Add text with bold, italic, underline formatting
- **E5**: Owner-Only Edit Restrictions - Visual ownership indicators

**Why this approach**:
- Expands core functionality
- Each tool builds on existing tool handler pattern
- Visible feature improvements for users

**Estimated Time**: 12-16 hours for all three

### Option 3: Polish & UX

**Focus on Advanced Features (A1, A2, A3)**

Improve user experience:
- **A1**: Canvas Export - Export to PNG/SVG
- **A2**: Undo/Redo System - Full history management
- **A3**: Enhanced Toolbar Design - Modern, professional styling

**Why this approach**:
- Improves existing features
- Professional polish
- Better user experience

**Estimated Time**: 10-14 hours for all three
