# Rotated Object Resize Implementation

## Date: October 18, 2025

## Overview
Implemented Konva Transformer to handle resizing of rotated objects (rectangles, circles, stars). This replaces custom resize handles when an object has rotation, providing professional rotation-aware resize behavior.

## Problem Statement
When objects are rotated, the custom resize handles don't account for the rotation transformation. Dragging handles on a rotated object would resize in the wrong direction and produce unexpected results.

## Solution
Implemented Konva's built-in `Transformer` component which automatically handles rotation-aware resizing with proper transformation matrices.

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified
- `src/components/canvas/Canvas.jsx`

### Changes Made

1. **Imported Transformer from react-konva**
   ```javascript
   import { Stage, Layer, Rect, Circle, Star, Arc, Line, Transformer } from 'react-konva';
   ```

2. **Added refs for transformer and selected shape**
   ```javascript
   const transformerRef = useRef(null);
   const selectedShapeRef = useRef(null);
   ```

3. **Added transformer state**
   ```javascript
   const [isTransforming, setIsTransforming] = useState(false);
   const [transformStartData, setTransformStartData] = useState(null);
   ```

4. **Attached transformer to rotated shapes**
   - Added useEffect to attach transformer when:
     - Tool is RESIZE
     - Object is selected
     - Object has rotation (rotation !== 0)
   - Clears transformer when conditions aren't met

5. **Updated shape rendering**
   - Conditionally attach `selectedShapeRef` to selected shape when in resize mode and has rotation
   - All shapes now check for rotation before rendering

6. **Hid custom resize handles for rotated objects**
   - Modified resize handle rendering for rectangles, circles, and stars
   - Custom handles only show when `rotation === 0` or undefined
   - Transformer handles rotation-aware resizing instead

7. **Added Transformer component**
   - Only renders when:
     - Tool is RESIZE
     - Object is selected  
     - Object has rotation
     - Object is not locked by another user
   - Configuration:
     - `rotateEnabled={false}` - disable rotation (use Rotate tool for that)
     - `enabledAnchors` - corner handles only (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right)
     - `boundBoxFunc` - enforces minimum size (10px) and canvas boundaries
   
8. **Transformation event handling**
   - `onTransform`: 
     - Resets scale to prevent double scaling
     - Updates dimensions appropriately per shape type
     - Maintains rotation value
     - Updates local state for immediate visual feedback
     - Sends real-time updates to RTDB
   - `onTransformEnd`:
     - Clears RTDB active object
     - Syncs final dimensions + rotation to Firestore
     - Keeps object locked for continued editing
     - Clears local updates

## Shape-Specific Behavior

### Rectangles
- Transformer scales width and height independently
- Maintains x, y, width, height, and rotation

### Circles
- Transformer scales radius (uses max of scaleX, scaleY)
- Maintains x, y, radius, and rotation

### Stars
- Transformer scales both inner and outer radius (uses average scale)
- Maintains proportional relationship between radii
- Maintains x, y, innerRadius, outerRadius, numPoints, and rotation

## User Experience

### Before
- Rotated objects could not be resized properly
- Custom resize handles didn't account for rotation
- Resizing produced unexpected, broken results

### After
- Rotated objects show professional Konva Transformer handles
- Handles rotate with the object
- Resizing works intuitively in all directions
- Matches UX of professional design tools (Figma, Adobe XD)

## Technical Benefits

1. **Automatic transformation math** - No manual rotation matrix calculations
2. **Battle-tested** - Uses Konva's proven transformer implementation
3. **Consistent UX** - Matches industry standards
4. **Less code** - Removed need for complex custom handle rotation logic
5. **Fewer bugs** - Konva handles edge cases automatically

## Testing Requirements

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Create rectangle, rotate it, resize it
- [ ] Create circle, rotate it, resize it
- [ ] Create star, rotate it, resize it
- [ ] Verify handles rotate with object
- [ ] Verify resizing maintains proportions correctly
- [ ] Verify boundary constraints work
- [ ] Verify minimum size enforcement
- [ ] Test multiplayer sync during transform
- [ ] Verify Firestore persistence

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Resizing near canvas boundaries
- [ ] Extreme rotations (90°, 180°, 270°)
- [ ] Very small objects
- [ ] Rapid resize operations
- [ ] Network latency scenarios

## Known Limitations

1. **Mixed UI**: Non-rotated objects still use custom handles, rotated objects use Transformer
   - Could be unified by always using Transformer, but custom handles are simpler for non-rotated case
   
2. **Ref attachment**: Requires conditional ref attachment in render
   - Works but is somewhat complex

## Future Enhancements

1. Consider using Transformer for all resize operations (even non-rotated)
2. Add aspect ratio locking with Shift key
3. Add center-point resizing with Alt key
4. Add visual feedback for boundary constraints
