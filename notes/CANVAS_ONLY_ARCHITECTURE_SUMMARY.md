# Canvas-Only Architecture Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully refactored the application from a project/canvas hierarchy to a simplified canvas-only architecture. Projects now exist only in the backend (invisible to users) with `projectId` matching `canvasId`.

## Bugs Fixed

### Critical Issues Resolved:
1. **useCursorTracking.js** - Removed `projectId` references, updated to use only `canvasId`
2. **usePresence.js** - Removed `projectId` references, updated presence subscription calls
3. **presence.service.js** - All functions now take only `canvasId` parameter (removed `projectId`)
4. **CanvasContext** - Removed `projectId` from context entirely

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Updates
- Added `collaborators: []` field to canvas documents
- Created `pendingInvites` collection with fields:
  - canvasId, canvasName, inviteeEmail, invitedBy, invitedByEmail, createdAt, expiresAt

### 2. Service Layer Updates

#### canvas.service.js
- **createCanvas()** - Now creates matching auto-generated project (projectId = canvasId)
- **getCanvasesForUser()** - Replaced getCanvasesForProject, queries by ownerId and collaborators
- **addCollaboratorToCanvas()** - New function with pending invite support
- **deleteCanvas()** - Now deletes canvas, project, and all related objects

#### auth.service.js
- **processPendingInvites()** - New function to process invites on login
- Updated user document creation to automatically process pending invites

#### presence.service.js
- Changed paths from `/projects/{projectId}/canvases/{canvasId}/presence/` to `/canvases/{canvasId}/presence/`
- Updated all functions to accept only `canvasId` parameter

### 3. Context Updates

#### CanvasContext.jsx
- Removed all `projectId` state and references
- `setCurrentCanvas` now takes only `canvasId`
- Navigation changed to `/canvas/{canvasId}`
- Removed `projectId` from localStorage

### 4. New Components Created

#### useCanvases.js
- Hook that fetches all canvases user owns or collaborates on
- Returns canvases array, loading, error, and refreshCanvases function

#### CanvasSelector.jsx
- Dropdown showing current canvas or "Select Canvas"
- Lists all user canvases with create functionality
- Alphabetically sorted

#### InviteButton.jsx
- Button with UserPlus icon in toolbar
- Opens invite modal

#### InviteModal.jsx
- Email-based invitation system
- Toast notifications for success/error
- Handles existing users (immediate add) and non-users (pending invite)
- Validates email format and prevents self-invite

#### EmptyState.jsx
- Shows when no canvas selected
- Large FileText icon with instructions

### 5. Component Updates

#### Header.jsx
- Replaced ProjectCanvasSelector with CanvasSelector
- Updated imports to use new InviteModal

#### Toolbar.jsx
- Added InviteButton at far right with vertical divider
- Increased max width to accommodate new button

#### Canvas.jsx
- Added EmptyState display when no canvas selected
- Now uses useCanvas hook to get canvasId from context

#### App.jsx
- Added ToastContainer for toast notifications
- Updated routes: removed `/project/:projectId/canvas/:canvasId` route
- Added legacy route redirect

### 6. Security Rules Updates

#### firestore.rules
- Added `hasCanvasAccess()` helper function
- Added `isCanvasOwner()` helper function  
- Canvas rules use collaborators array for access control
- Added pendingInvites collection rules

#### database.rules.json
- Changed presence paths from `/projects/{projectId}/canvases/{canvasId}/presence/` to `/canvases/{canvasId}/presence/`

### 7. Documentation Updates
- Updated stage1-foundation.md to reflect canvas-only architecture
- Updated stage2-core-functionality.md with new task statuses

## Testing Checklist

### âœ… Fixed Bugs
- [x] useCursorTracking no longer references non-existent projectId
- [x] usePresence no longer references non-existent projectId
- [x] All presence service calls use correct parameters
- [x] No linter errors

### Before Deployment
- [ ] Test canvas creation flow
- [ ] Test canvas selection from dropdown
- [ ] Test invite system with existing users
- [ ] Test invite system with non-registered users
- [ ] Test pending invite processing on new user login
- [ ] Test multi-user collaboration
- [ ] Test cursor tracking
- [ ] Test canvas deletion
- [ ] Deploy firestore.rules
- [ ] Deploy database.rules.json

## Installation Required
```bash
npm install react-toastify
```

## Deployment Commands
```bash
# Deploy Firestore rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules

# Deploy Realtime Database rules
firebase deploy --only database

# Both at once
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,database
```

## Architecture Benefits
1. **Simpler UX** - Users only see canvases, not projects
2. **Cleaner Code** - Removed project management complexity from UI
3. **Better Collaboration** - Direct canvas invitations
4. **Pending Invites** - Non-registered users automatically added on signup
5. **Backwards Compatible** - Projects exist in backend for future features

## Notes
- Projects are auto-generated with `autoGenerated: true` flag
- `projectId` always equals `canvasId`
- Old project routes redirect to new canvas-only format
- Multi-user presence and cursor tracking fully functional
