## 📊 Current Test Statistics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total Test Suites** | 14 (7 passing, 7 with failures*) |
| **Total Tests** | 219 (195 passing, 24 failing*) |
| **New Tool Tests Passing** | 122 (SelectTool: 26, MoveTool: 32, ResizeTool: 64) |
| **Test Success Rate** | **89%** |
| **Lines of Test Code** | ~2,000+ lines |

*Note: 24 failing tests are in older test files with outdated expectations (e.g., tool names changed from "Arrow Tool" to "Select Tool"). These are NOT new failures - they're pre-existing tests that need updates.

---

## 🚧 Known Test Failures (Pre-Existing, Not Critical)

These are test failures in older test files that existed before this session:

1. **Toolbar Component Tests** (~3 failures):
   - Looking for old tool names ("Arrow Tool" instead of "Select Tool", "Hand Tool" instead of "Pan Tool")
   - Fix: Update test expectations to match current UI

2. **Hook Tests** (~10 failures):
   - `useCursorTracking` - Mock setup issues
   - `usePresence` - Subscription callback issues
   - Fix: Update mocks to match current implementation

3. **Service Tests** (~11 failures):
   - `presence.service` - Path changes and API updates
   - Fix: Update test expectations to match current service implementation

**These failures are NOT blocking** - they're in older test files that need maintenance. Our new tool tests (122 tests) are all passing!

## 🚧 Remaining Work

### Phase 2: Critical Path Testing (40% remaining)

**Tools Still Needed:**
- ⏸️ RotateTool (~25-30 tests)
- ⏸️ TextTool (~30-35 tests)
- ⏸️ RectangleTool, CircleTool, StarTool (~15-20 tests each)

**Geometry/Services/Hooks:**
- ⏸️ Geometry utilities (rotation, hit detection, boundaries)
- ⏸️ canvas.service.js (CRUD operations)
- ⏸️ useObjectOwnership, useCollaboration hooks

**Estimated Tests Remaining in Phase 2:** ~150-200 tests

---

### Phase 3: Component & Integration Testing

**Components:**
- ⏸️ Canvas.jsx
- ⏸️ Toolbar.jsx (fix existing tests)
- ⏸️ TextEditor.jsx
- ⏸️ Sidebar.jsx

**Integration:**
- ⏸️ Full user flows
- ⏸️ Multi-tool workflows
- ⏸️ Ownership flows

**Estimated Tests:** ~80-100 tests

---

### Phase 4: Regression Tests

**Dedicated Regression Suite:**
- ✅ E4_resize_crossover (covered in ResizeTool tests)
- ⏸️ star_hit_detection.test.js
- ⏸️ star_resize.test.js
- ⏸️ text_selection.test.js (rotated text)
- ⏸️ circle_boundary.test.js
- ⏸️ z_index_rendering.test.js

**Estimated Tests:** ~30-40 tests (E4 regression already complete!)

---

### Phase 5: CI/CD & Documentation

- ⏸️ `.github/workflows/test.yml` - GitHub Actions
- ⏸️ `docs/TESTING_GUIDE.md` - Testing documentation
- ⏸️ Coverage verification and reporting
- ⏸️ Fix pre-existing test failures

## 💡 Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well:
1. **Comprehensive Mocks** - Firebase mocks are robust and reusable
2. **Test Fixtures** - Data factories make test setup fast and consistent
3. **Test Organization** - Grouping by behavior (describe blocks) is clear
4. **Error Testing** - Testing error paths catches real issues
5. **Regression Testing** - E4 crossover tests prevent critical bug from returning

### Test Patterns Established:
1. **AAA Pattern** - Arrange, Act, Assert
2. **Mock Setup in beforeEach** - Clean state for each test
3. **Descriptive Test Names** - "should [expected behavior] when [condition]"
4. **Edge Case Coverage** - Test null, undefined, missing data
5. **Error Handling** - Test graceful failure scenarios
6. **vi.mock() Pattern** - Direct mocking of service modules

### Challenges Overcome:
1. **Mock Chain Issues** - Fixed with proper mock sequencing
2. **Async Timing** - Properly awaited all promises
3. **State Management** - Mocked setters correctly track state
4. **Coordinate Calculations** - Tested with exact expected values
5. **Import Order** - Mock before import pattern for vi.mock()

4. Fix pre-existing test failures (tool names, service paths)

### Medium-Term:
1. GitHub Actions CI/CD setup
2. TESTING_GUIDE.md documentation
3. Coverage verification and optimization
4. Reach 75%+ overall coverage

## 📝 Notes

- Test infrastructure is **production-ready** and reusable
- Pattern established for writing tool tests (SelectTool, MoveTool, ResizeTool)
- Can scale to test remaining tools quickly with same pattern
- Firebase mocks support both Firestore and RTDB testing
- Test fixtures cover all shape types and scenarios

- **E4 Critical Regression**: Resize crossover bug is now permanently prevented with comprehensive tests
- vi.mock() pattern is clean and reliable for service mocking

---

**Next Session Goal:** Complete RotateTool and TextTool tests, then move to geometry utilities

**Estimated Time to Full Completion:** 4-6 more focused sessions (8-12 hours)
