# Resize Tool Refactor - Moving Tool-Specific Code

**Date**: October 17, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Complete

## Overview
Cleaned up `Canvas.jsx` by moving resize-specific logic from Canvas component to ResizeTool class, following the separation of concerns principle.

## Changes Made

### 1. Functions Moved to ResizeTool.js

#### `getClosestCorner(pos, obj)` (Lines 587-645 → ResizeTool method)
- **Purpose**: Detects which resize handle (corner) was clicked based on mouse position
- **Why moved**: Only used by ResizeTool for handle detection during resize operations
- **Implementation**: Now a method in ResizeTool class, called via `this.getClosestCorner()`

#### `handleCrossoverDetection(currentRect, currentHandle, originalRect)` (Lines 502-585 → ResizeTool method)
- **Purpose**: Handles rectangle corner flipping when resizing past opposite corners
- **Why moved**: Specific to rectangle resize behavior, only used by ResizeTool
- **Implementation**: Now a method in ResizeTool class, called via `this.handleCrossoverDetection()`

### 2. Canvas.jsx Updates

**Removed**:
- `getClosestCorner` function (63 lines)
- `handleCrossoverDetection` function (83 lines)
- Both functions from `buildToolState` helper object
- References from dependency arrays in handleMouseDown, handleMouseMove, handleMouseUp

**Result**: Canvas.jsx is ~146 lines cleaner and more focused on rendering and coordination

### 3. ResizeTool.js Updates

**Added**:
- `getClosestCorner` method (60 lines)
- `handleCrossoverDetection` method (85 lines)

**Modified**:
- `onMouseDown`: Changed `getClosestCorner(pos, selectedObject)` to `this.getClosestCorner(pos, selectedObject)`
- `onMouseMove`: Changed `handleCrossoverDetection(...)` to `this.handleCrossoverDetection(...)`
- Removed both functions from destructured state object

## Code Kept in Canvas.jsx (Correctly Shared)

These functions remain in Canvas because they're used by **multiple tools**:

1. **Shape hit detection functions**:
   - `findObjectAt()` - Used by Select, Move, and other tools
   - `findRectAt()`, `findCircleAt()`, `findStarAt()` - Shape-specific detection
   - `isPointInRect()`, `isPointInCircle()`, `isPointInStar()` - Geometric tests

2. **Boundary enforcement**:
   - `clampRectToCanvas()` - Used by multiple tools
   - `clampCircleToCanvas()` - Used by multiple tools
   - `clampStarToCanvas()` - Used by multiple tools

3. **Rendering**:
   - All resize handle rendering (lines 1255-1395) - Canvas is responsible for all visual rendering

## Benefits

1. **Better Separation of Concerns**: Resize-specific logic lives with ResizeTool
2. **Cleaner Canvas Component**: Removed 146 lines of tool-specific code
3. **Easier Maintenance**: Changes to resize logic happen in one place
4. **Follows Tool Architecture Pattern**: Each tool owns its behavior
5. **No Breaking Changes**: All functionality preserved, just reorganized

## Testing

- ✅ No linter errors
- ⏳ Needs visual/functional testing:
  - Rectangle resize with corner handles
  - Circle resize with corner handles
  - Star resize with corner handles
  - Corner crossover detection (drag handle past opposite corner)
  - Multi-user resize synchronization

## Files Modified

1. `/src/tools/ResizeTool.js` (+145 lines)
2. `/src/components/canvas/Canvas.jsx` (-146 lines)

## Next Steps

1. Run application and test resize functionality
2. Test corner crossover behavior specifically
3. Test multi-shape resize (rectangles, circles, stars)
4. Confirm all resize scenarios work as before

---

**Note**: This refactor maintains all existing functionality while improving code organization. The resize tool now owns all its logic instead of relying on Canvas to provide resize-specific helpers.
