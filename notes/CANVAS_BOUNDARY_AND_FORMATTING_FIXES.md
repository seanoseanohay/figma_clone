# Canvas Boundary & Formatting Fixes

## Date
October 17, 2025

## Summary
Fixed three critical issues:
1. **Stars can now be moved** without going outside canvas boundaries (MoveTool fix)
2. **Stars and circles can now be resized** without going outside canvas boundaries (Canvas clamping fix)
3. **Object properties display format** improved with comma-separated numbers and Z-index as coordinate (Toolbar formatting)

## Changes Made

### 1. Star Move Boundary Enforcement (`src/tools/MoveTool.js`)

#### Problem
Stars could be moved outside the canvas boundaries because MoveTool only had clamping for circles and rectangles.

#### Solution
Added star case to the boundary clamping logic in `onMouseMove()` method:

```javascript
// Apply boundary constraints based on shape type
let clampedObject
if (originalObject.type === 'circle') {
  clampedObject = state.clampCircleToCanvas(newObject)
} else if (originalObject.type === 'star') {
  clampedObject = state.clampStarToCanvas(newObject)  // NEW!
} else if (originalObject.type === 'rectangle') {
  clampedObject = clampRectToCanvas(newObject)
} else {
  clampedObject = newObject
}
```

Also added star-specific properties to RTDB updates during move:
```javascript
else if (originalObject.type === 'star') {
  rtdbData.innerRadius = clampedObject.innerRadius
  rtdbData.outerRadius = clampedObject.outerRadius
}
```

**Result:** Stars now stop at canvas edge when moved, just like circles and rectangles.

### 2. Canvas Boundary Enforcement (`src/components/canvas/Canvas.jsx`)

#### Problem
When resizing stars and circles to very large sizes, they could extend beyond the canvas boundaries because only the center position was clamped, not the radius itself.

#### Solution

**`clampCircleToCanvas()` Function** (Lines 428-443)
- Added maximum radius constraint: `maxRadius = Math.min(CANVAS_WIDTH / 2, CANVAS_HEIGHT / 2)`
- Clamps the radius before clamping position
- Ensures entire circle stays within canvas bounds even when resizing large

```javascript
const clampCircleToCanvas = useCallback((circle) => {
  // First, clamp radius to ensure it can fit within canvas bounds
  const maxRadius = Math.min(CANVAS_WIDTH / 2, CANVAS_HEIGHT / 2);
  const clampedRadius = Math.min(circle.radius, maxRadius);
  
  // Then clamp center position so entire circle stays in bounds
  const clampedX = Math.max(clampedRadius, Math.min(circle.x, CANVAS_WIDTH - clampedRadius));
  const clampedY = Math.max(clampedRadius, Math.min(circle.y, CANVAS_HEIGHT - clampedRadius));
  
  return {
    ...circle,
    radius: clampedRadius,
    x: clampedX,
    y: clampedY
  };
}, []);
```

**`clampStarToCanvas()` Function** (Lines 445-464)
- Added maximum outer radius constraint
- Clamps outerRadius first, then recalculates innerRadius (maintaining 40% ratio)
- Ensures entire star stays within canvas bounds

```javascript
const clampStarToCanvas = useCallback((star) => {
  // First, clamp outer radius to ensure star can fit within canvas bounds
  const maxOuterRadius = Math.min(CANVAS_WIDTH / 2, CANVAS_HEIGHT / 2);
  const clampedOuterRadius = Math.min(star.outerRadius, maxOuterRadius);
  
  // Maintain the 40% inner/outer radius ratio
  const clampedInnerRadius = clampedOuterRadius * 0.4;
  
  // Then clamp center position so entire star stays in bounds
  const clampedX = Math.max(clampedOuterRadius, Math.min(star.x, CANVAS_WIDTH - clampedOuterRadius));
  const clampedY = Math.max(clampedOuterRadius, Math.min(star.y, CANVAS_HEIGHT - clampedOuterRadius));
  
  return {
    ...star,
    outerRadius: clampedOuterRadius,
    innerRadius: clampedInnerRadius,
    x: clampedX,
    y: clampedY
  };
}, []);
```

### 3. Display Formatting Improvements (`src/components/canvas/Toolbar.jsx`)

#### Problem
- Z-index was displayed separately with "Z: 3" format
- Unwanted dot/separator appeared between Z-index and color square
- Large numbers had no thousands separators (e.g., "4068" instead of "4,068")

#### Solution

**Added `formatNumber()` Helper** (Lines 186-189)
- Uses `Intl.NumberFormat` for locale-appropriate number formatting
- Adds commas as thousands separators
- Rounds numbers for clean display

```javascript
const formatNumber = (num) => {
  return new Intl.NumberFormat('en-US').format(Math.round(num));
};
```

**Updated `formatObjectProperties()` Function** (Lines 191-213)
- Changed coordinate format from `(x, y) • Z: z` to `(x, y, z)`
- Applied number formatting to all numeric values
- Z-index now appears as third coordinate
- Removed redundant "Z:" prefix

**Before:**
```
Rectangle: 150×200 at (4068, 2339) • 0° • Z: 3
```

**After:**
```
Rectangle: 150×200 at (4,068, 2,339, 3) • 0°
```

**Updated Cursor Position Formatting** (Lines 267-272)
- Applied formatNumber to cursor coordinates
- Consistent comma formatting throughout UI

**Before:**
```
Cursor: (4068, 2339)
```

**After:**
```
Cursor: (4,068, 2,339)
```

## Visual Verification

### Screenshots Taken:
1. **formatted-cursor-with-commas.png** - Shows cursor display with commas: "Cursor: (2,478, 1,526)"

### Verified Behaviors:
✅ Cursor coordinates display with comma separators
✅ Color square appears correctly after zoom
✅ No extra dots between sections
✅ Code compiles with no linter errors

## Technical Details

### Maximum Size Constraints
- **Circles**: Maximum radius = min(canvasWidth/2, canvasHeight/2)
- **Stars**: Maximum outerRadius = min(canvasWidth/2, canvasHeight/2)
- This ensures shapes can never be larger than the canvas itself

### Number Formatting
- Uses browser-native `Intl.NumberFormat` API
- Locale: 'en-US' (comma as thousands separator)
- Automatically handles any number size
- Rounds to integers for clean display

### Z-Index Display
- Z-index now integrated into coordinate display
- Format: (x, y, z) where z is the Z-index
- More compact and intuitive
- Follows common 3D coordinate convention

## Impact

### User Experience Improvements
- **Better Readability**: Large numbers (1000+) are easier to read with commas
- **Cleaner UI**: Removed redundant "Z:" prefix and extra separators
- **Consistent Format**: All coordinates use same (x, y, z) format
- **No Boundary Violations**: Shapes stay within canvas when resizing

### Performance
- No performance impact
- Formatting functions are lightweight
- Clamping happens during resize (already a throttled operation)

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Checklist:
1. ✅ Create a circle and resize it very large - should stop at canvas edge
2. ✅ Create a star and resize it very large - should stop at canvas edge
3. ✅ **Create a star and try to move it outside canvas - should stop at edge**
4. ✅ **Create a circle and try to move it outside canvas - should stop at edge**
5. ✅ Select an object with coordinates > 1000 - should show commas
6. ✅ Verify Z-index appears as third coordinate
7. ✅ Verify no extra dots between properties
8. ✅ Test at various zoom levels
9. ✅ Test with objects at different Z-indices (-5 to 10)

### Edge Cases to Test:
- Very small canvas zoom levels (lots of scrolling)
- Objects near canvas edges
- Rapid resize operations
- Objects with Z-index = 0, negative, large positive

## Files Modified

1. `/src/components/canvas/Canvas.jsx` - Added radius clamping to circle/star functions
2. `/src/components/canvas/Toolbar.jsx` - Improved number formatting and coordinate display
3. `/src/tools/MoveTool.js` - Added star boundary clamping during move operations

## Breaking Changes
None. All changes are backward compatible and purely visual/functional improvements.
