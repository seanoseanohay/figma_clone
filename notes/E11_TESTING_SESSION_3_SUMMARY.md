## 🔍 Key Test Patterns Established

### Shape Creation Tools (Rectangle, Circle, Star)

**Common Pattern:**
1. Mouse down → Start drawing at position
2. Mouse move → Update dimensions/radius preview
3. Mouse up → Finalize and create object

**Common Tests:**
- Tool properties (cursor style)
- Start drawing on mouse down
- Prevent simultaneous draws
- Dimension/radius calculation
- Minimum size enforcement
- Canvas boundary clamping
- Color application (selected or default)
- Online/offline handling
- Error handling (createObject failures)
- State reset after creation
- Edge cases (large shapes, origin, sequences)

### Unique Aspects Tested

**CircleTool Specifics:**
- Radius calculated using Pythagorean theorem
- Minimum radius: 1 pixel
- Center-based creation (drag from center)

**StarTool Specifics:**
- Inner radius: 40% of outer radius
- Number of points: Always 5
- Minimum outer radius: 5 pixels
- Center-based creation (drag from center)

**RectangleTool Specifics:**
- Width/height calculation
- Negative dimension normalization (drag left/up)
- Minimum dimensions: 2px width, 1px height
- Corner-based creation (drag from corner)

## 🐛 Regression Tests Included

### E4 Critical Regression (in ResizeTool tests):
- ✅ NW → SE crossover (horizontal + vertical)
- ✅ NE → SW crossover
- ✅ SE → NW crossover
- ✅ SW → NE crossover
- ✅ Handle flipping without position jumping
- ✅ Smooth resize through crossover points

This ensures the critical E4 resize bug can never return!

- ⏸️ Canvas.jsx - Rendering, tool switching, keyboard shortcuts
- ⏸️ Toolbar.jsx - Tool buttons, properties display (fix existing tests)
- ⏸️ TextEditor.jsx - Editor overlay, formatting

## 💡 Key Insights

### Shape Tool Testing Patterns

**Similarities Across Shape Tools:**
- All use same mouse down → move → up pattern
- All require minimum size enforcement
- All need canvas boundary clamping
- All support color selection
- All handle online/offline states
- All need error handling

**Differences:**
- **Rectangle**: Corner-based, negative dimensions, 2px×1px minimum
- **Circle**: Center-based, radius calculation, 1px minimum
- **Star**: Center-based, dual radii (inner/outer), 5px minimum, always 5 points

### Test Quality

**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive coverage of all code paths
- Clear, descriptive test names
- Proper mocking (no real Firebase/network calls)
- Fast execution (<1 second per file)
- Deterministic (no random failures)
- Edge case coverage
- Error handling verification

**Best Practices Followed:**
- Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- One assertion per test (mostly)
- Isolated tests (no dependencies between tests)
- Mock setup in beforeEach
- Mock cleanup in afterEach
- Descriptive test names: "should [expected behavior] when [condition]"
