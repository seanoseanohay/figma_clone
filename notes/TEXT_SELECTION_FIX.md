# Text Selection Fix: Keep Text Selected After Editing

## Issue Description
After editing existing text and saving it, the text object was not remaining selected. This required users to:
1. Edit text → Save
2. Click away to deselect
3. Click text again to reselect
4. Then switch to Resize/Rotate/Move tool

**Expected Behavior**: After editing text and saving, it should stay selected so you can immediately use other tools (Resize, Rotate, Move) without needing to reselect.

## Root Cause
In `Canvas.jsx`, the text save handler had different behavior for new vs existing text:

**Creating New Text** (lines 1871-1879):
```javascript
const textId = await textTool.createTextObject(...);
setTextSelectedId(textId);    // ✅ Selects the text
setSelectedObjectId(textId);  // ✅ Selects the text
```

**Editing Existing Text** (lines 1880-1892):
```javascript
await updateObject(textEditData.object.id, updates);
await unlockObject(textEditData.object.id);
// ❌ Did NOT keep the text selected!
```

## Solution
Added selection state management after editing existing text to match the behavior of creating new text.

## Files Modified

### `src/components/canvas/Canvas.jsx`
**Lines 1893-1895** (added):
```javascript
// Keep the text selected so user can immediately use other tools (resize, rotate, etc.)
setTextSelectedId(textEditData.object.id);
setSelectedObjectId(textEditData.object.id);
```

**Complete Context** (lines 1880-1896):
```javascript
} else if (textEditData.object) {
  // Editing existing text
  const updates = {
    text,
    ...formatting
  };
  
  await updateObject(textEditData.object.id, updates);
  console.log('✅ Text updated:', textEditData.object.id);
  
  // Unlock the text
  await unlockObject(textEditData.object.id);
  
  // Keep the text selected so user can immediately use other tools (resize, rotate, etc.)
  setTextSelectedId(textEditData.object.id);
  setSelectedObjectId(textEditData.object.id);
}
```

## Testing Steps

### Manual Testing Required
1. **Edit Existing Text**:
   - Create text: "Hello World"
   - Save it
   - Double-click text to edit it
   - Change to: "Hello Universe"
   - Press Enter to save

2. **Verify Selection**:
   - Text should have blue selection border after saving
   - Modification tools (Move, Resize, Rotate) should be enabled
   - No need to click away and reselect

3. **Test Immediate Tool Usage**:
   - After saving edited text (step 1)
   - Click Resize tool
   - Resize handles should appear immediately
   - Start resizing without needing to reselect

4. **Test with New Text**:
   - Create brand new text: "New Text"
   - Press Enter to save
   - Verify it stays selected (this already worked, confirming no regression)

### Edge Cases to Test
- ✅ Edit text, save → stays selected
- ✅ Edit text, cancel → deselects (unlock happens without selection)
- ✅ Create new text, save → stays selected (existing behavior maintained)
- ✅ Switch tools while text selected → tool activation works immediately

## Expected Results

**Before Fix**:
```
Edit text → Save → [Text deselected] → Click text → Click Resize → Resize
         (5 steps, frustrating UX)
```

**After Fix**:
```
Edit text → Save → [Text stays selected] → Click Resize → Resize
         (3 steps, smooth UX)
```

## User Impact

**Positive Changes**:
- ✅ Faster workflow - no extra clicks needed
- ✅ Matches intuitive behavior - edited object stays selected
- ✅ Consistent with other design tools (Figma, Canva)
- ✅ Reduces cognitive load - no need to remember to reselect

**No Negative Impact**:
- Selection can still be cleared by clicking empty space
- Escape key still deselects
- Cancel still works as expected

## Technical Details

### State Management
The fix ensures `selectedObjectId` and `textSelectedId` are maintained after:
1. Updating the text object in Firestore
2. Unlocking the text object
3. Before clearing the editing state

### Tool Activation
With the text selected after save:
- `hasSelection` prop is true in Toolbar
- Modification tools (Move, Resize, Rotate) become enabled
- Keyboard shortcuts ('M', 'R', 'T') work immediately
- Tool switching syncs the selection state properly

### Multiplayer Considerations
- Text is unlocked before selection state is set
- Other users see the text become available immediately
- Selection is local to each user (as expected)

- `src/components/canvas/Canvas.jsx` - Main fix location
- `src/components/canvas/TextEditor.jsx` - Unchanged (works with fix)
- `src/tools/SelectTool.js` - Double-click edit trigger (unchanged)

## Deployment Notes
- ✅ No database changes required
- ✅ No breaking changes
- ✅ Backward compatible
- ✅ No linter errors
- ✅ Can deploy immediately

## Conclusion
This fix eliminates a frustrating workflow issue where users had to manually reselect text after editing it. The text now stays selected after save, allowing immediate use of other tools (Resize, Rotate, Move) without extra clicks.

The behavior now matches user expectations and professional design tools, improving overall UX and workflow efficiency.
