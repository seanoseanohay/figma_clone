# Stage 3 Task List Update - October 18, 2025

## Summary
Updated the Stage 3 task list to reflect accurate completion status and reorganize remaining tasks based on user requirements.

## Key Changes

### 1. E6 (Rotation Tool) Status Corrected ‚úÖ
**Finding**: E6 was marked as "Partial" in the task list, but investigation revealed it was actually **fully complete** as of October 17, 2025.

**Evidence**:
- Complete implementation in `src/tools/RotateTool.js`
- Full visual rendering in Canvas.jsx (rotation handle with dashed line)
- Manual rotation input field in Toolbar.jsx
- Completion note documenting all features: `notes/E6_ROTATION_TOOL_COMPLETE.md`

**Status Updated**: üîÑ Partial ‚Üí ‚úÖ Complete

**Features Confirmed Working**:
- ‚úÖ Interactive rotation handle (blue circle, 30px above object)
- ‚úÖ Drag to rotate with real-time feedback
- ‚úÖ Shift+drag snapping to 15¬∞ increments
- ‚úÖ Manual angle input field (0-359¬∞) with arrow key support
- ‚úÖ Rotation persistence via Firestore + RTDB sync
- ‚úÖ Keyboard shortcut 'T' to activate tool
- ‚úÖ Works with all shape types (rectangles, circles, stars, text)

### 2. A4 (Object Deletion) Added ‚è∏Ô∏è
**New Task**: Implement object deletion using Delete/Backspace keys

**Key Requirements**:
- Delete selected objects with Delete or Backspace key
- No warning prompts (undo/redo is the safety net)
- Respect ownership/locking restrictions
- Support multiple selected objects
- Queue deletions when offline, sync on reconnect

**Dependencies**: 
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires A2 (Undo/Redo System) to be implemented first
- Uses E5 (Ownership UI) to show who owns objects before deleting

**Implementation Details**:
- Both Delete and Backspace keys supported
- Soft delete pattern with `deletedAt` timestamp
- Integration with undo/redo history
- Real-time sync across all users
- Proper cleanup (Firestore, RTDB, local state)

### 3. A0 (Performance Optimization) Deferred ‚ùå
**Action**: Moved A0 to end of task list per user request

**Rationale**:
- Current performance is acceptable for typical use
- Optimization best done after all features complete
- Not blocking any other features
- Can be addressed in Stage 4 or as needed

**Status**: ‚ùå DEFERRED (was ‚è∏Ô∏è Not Started)

### 4. Updated Recommended Order
**New Sequence**:
1. **E5** - Ownership UI (visual indicators + edit restrictions)
2. **A2** - Undo/Redo System (safety net for deletion)
3. **A4** - Object Deletion (safe with undo/redo)
4. **A1** - Canvas Export (PNG/SVG)
5. **A3** - Toolbar Design (visual polish)
6. **A0** - Performance (deferred to end)

**Previous Sequence**:
1. E6 - Complete Rotation Tool (thought to be partial)
2. E5 - Ownership UI
3. A0-A3 - Polish features

**Why the Change**:
- E6 was already complete, no work needed
- E5 is now the only remaining Enhanced Tool (completes E1-E10)
- A2 must come before A4 (undo needed for safe deletion)
- A0 deferred per user request

## Progress Summary

### Stage 3 Overall Progress: 9/14 tasks complete (64%)

**Completed (9)**:
- ‚úÖ E1: Circle Creation Tool
- ‚úÖ E2: Properties Display in Toolbar
- ‚úÖ E3: Text Tool with Formatting
- ‚úÖ E4: Fix Rectangle Resize Bug
- ‚úÖ E6: Object Rotation Tool
- ‚úÖ E7: Star Shape Tool
- ‚úÖ E8: Color Picker for Shapes
- ‚úÖ E9: Z-Index Management
- ‚úÖ E10: Continuous Text Editing

**Remaining (5)**:
- ‚è∏Ô∏è E5: Owner-Only Edit Restrictions
- ‚è∏Ô∏è A1: Canvas Export Functionality
- ‚è∏Ô∏è A2: Undo/Redo System
- ‚è∏Ô∏è A3: Toolbar Design Enhancement
- ‚è∏Ô∏è A4: Object Deletion (new)

**Deferred (1)**:
- ‚ùå A0: Performance Optimization & Monitoring

## Next Action: E5 (Ownership UI)

**Why E5 is recommended next**:
1. Completes all Enhanced Tools (E1-E10) - major milestone
2. Improves collaborative UX with visual ownership indicators
3. Prevents edit conflicts in multi-user scenarios
4. Foundation for safe deletion (A4) - users need to see who owns what
5. Relatively contained scope (visual + interaction blocking)

**What E5 Involves**:
- Add visual highlighting (border color matches owner's avatar color)
- Prevent non-owners from selecting/editing owned objects
- Show tooltip "Currently being edited by [User Name]"
- Real-time ownership indicator updates
- Smooth color transitions on ownership changes

## Files Modified
- **Updated**: `docs/stage3-enhanced-features.md`
  - Corrected E6 status to Complete
  - Added A4 task specification
  - Marked A0 as Deferred and moved to end
  - Updated progress summary (9/14 complete)
  - Revised recommended order

## Testing Notes
- No code changes required (E6 already complete)
- No linter errors introduced
- Documentation now accurately reflects implementation status

## User Feedback Incorporated
‚úÖ A0 marked as "do not do yet" and moved to end  
‚úÖ A4 (Object Deletion) added after undo/redo system  
‚úÖ Task list reviewed and updated accordingly  
‚úÖ Suggestions provided for optimal task sequence  

## Conclusion
Task list has been successfully reorganized to reflect:
1. Accurate completion status (E6 is done!)
2. New deletion feature (A4) with proper dependencies
3. Deferred optimization work (A0) 
4. Clear recommended path forward (E5 ‚Üí A2 ‚Üí A4 ‚Üí A1 ‚Üí A3)

Stage 3 is 64% complete with 5 tasks remaining plus 1 deferred.
