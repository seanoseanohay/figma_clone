# Deployment Checklist - Smooth Object Movement

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Deploy in This Order

### Step 1: Deploy Firebase Realtime Database Rules
```bash
firebase deploy --only database
```

**Why first?** The app will try to write to RTDB as soon as you start testing. Rules must be deployed before testing.

**Verify**: Check Firebase Console ‚Üí Realtime Database ‚Üí Rules tab

---

### Step 2: Test Locally (Before Deploying Code)

#### Quick Test (2 minutes):
1. Open browser window 1 ‚Üí Sign in ‚Üí Create a canvas
2. Open incognito window 2 ‚Üí Sign in (different user) ‚Üí Navigate to same canvas
3. Window 1: Create rectangle ‚Üí Drag it around
4. Window 2: **Should see smooth real-time movement** ‚úÖ

#### If Movement is Smooth:
‚úÖ Proceed to Step 3

#### If Not Working:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify RTDB rules deployed correctly
3. Check `/canvases/{canvasId}/activeObjects` in Firebase Console
4. Review `SMOOTH_OBJECT_MOVEMENT_IMPLEMENTATION.md` troubleshooting section

---

### Step 3: Build and Deploy to Vercel (Optional)

Only after confirming local tests pass:

```bash
npm run build
# Deploy to Vercel via your normal process
```

---

## Quick Verification Script

```bash
# 1. Deploy RTDB rules
firebase deploy --only database

# 2. Start dev server
npm run dev

# 3. Open in browser
# - Main window: http://localhost:5173
# - Incognito: http://localhost:5173

# 4. Test drag movement between windows
```

---

## Expected Behavior

### ‚úÖ Success Indicators:
- Object moves smoothly (no stuttering)
- ~13 position updates/second visible in Network tab
- No console errors
- Object stops at correct final position
- RTDB entry removed after drag ends

### ‚ùå Failure Indicators:
- Permission denied errors in console
- Object doesn't move for other user
- Choppy/stuttering movement
- Active objects not cleaning up

---

## Rollback Plan (If Issues Found)

```bash
# 1. Revert RTDB rules (comment out activeObjects section)
firebase deploy --only database

# 2. Revert code changes
git checkout HEAD~1 src/services/canvas.service.js
git checkout HEAD~1 src/components/canvas/Canvas.jsx

# 3. Redeploy
npm run build
```

---

## Post-Deployment Monitoring

### First 24 Hours:
- [ ] Monitor Firebase Console ‚Üí Realtime Database ‚Üí Usage
- [ ] Check for RTDB permission errors in error logs
- [ ] Verify costs are within expected range (~13 writes/sec per drag)
- [ ] Test with 3+ concurrent users dragging

### First Week:
- [ ] Gather user feedback on smoothness
- [ ] Monitor Firebase costs (should be minimal)
- [ ] Check for orphaned activeObjects entries
- [ ] Performance test with 10+ concurrent users

---

## Testing Requirements (From User Rules)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Canvas Page Testing Required
After deployment, you MUST verify:

1. ‚úÖ Canvas page still renders correctly
2. ‚úÖ All interactive elements work (click, drag, etc.)
3. ‚úÖ Test any animations or visual effects
4. ‚úÖ Confirm no console errors appear

**Changes that could affect canvas**:
- ‚úÖ Canvas-related components (Canvas.jsx)
- ‚úÖ Shared utilities used by canvas (canvas.service.js)
- ‚úÖ State management affecting canvas (activeObjects state)
- ‚úÖ Styling that might impact canvas (none in this change)

### Testing Confirmation Template:
```
‚úÖ Canvas page renders correctly
‚úÖ Click interactions work (select tool, select objects)
‚úÖ Drag interactions work (move tool, smooth movement)
‚úÖ Visual effects work (object locking, color indicators)
‚úÖ No console errors
‚úÖ Real-time movement is smooth across users
```

---

## Quick Start (TL;DR)

```bash
# 1. Deploy RTDB rules
firebase deploy --only database

# 2. Test with 2 browser windows
npm run dev

# 3. Verify smooth drag movement between windows

# 4. If working, deploy to production
npm run build
```

That's it! üöÄ
