# Resize Handles State Sync Fix

## Date
October 17, 2025

## Issue Reported
Visual bug where resize handles appeared on the wrong object:

**User's Sequence:**
1. Select Star A (pink) and resize it
2. Handles appear correctly on Star A ‚úÖ
3. Select Star B (yellow) with Select Tool
4. Switch to Resize Tool
5. **BUG**: Handles appear on Star A (pink) instead of Star B (yellow) ‚ùå
6. Yellow star has selection border (blue), but pink star has resize handles
7. After clicking, handles correct themselves to yellow star

**Visual Evidence:**
User provided screenshot showing:
- Yellow star: Selected (blue border)
- Pink star: Has resize handles (blue squares)
- This is backwards!

## Root Cause

**State Desynchronization**: The application maintains two separate selection states:
- `selectedObjectId` - Global selection state (updated by Select Tool)
- `resizeSelectedId` - Resize tool's internal state (only updated by Resize Tool)

When you switch tools, these states don't automatically sync.

### What Was Happening:

```javascript
// Step 1: Select pink star
selectedObjectId = 'pink-star-id'

// Step 2: Switch to Resize Tool
// resizeSelectedId doesn't exist yet, gets set during first use
resizeSelectedId = 'pink-star-id'  // Set by ResizeTool.js on mouse down

// Step 3: Resize pink star
// resizeSelectedId remains 'pink-star-id' (correct)

// Step 4: Switch back to Select Tool
selectedObjectId = 'pink-star-id'  // Still pink

// Step 5: Select yellow star
selectedObjectId = 'yellow-star-id'  // Updated! ‚úÖ
resizeSelectedId = 'pink-star-id'    // NOT updated! ‚ùå (stale)

// Step 6: Switch to Resize Tool
// Handles render based on resizeSelectedId = 'pink-star-id'
// But selectedObjectId = 'yellow-star-id'
// Result: Handles on wrong star!
```

The resize handles render based on `resizeSelectedId`, but the selection border renders based on `selectedObjectId`. When these get out of sync, handles appear on the wrong object.

## The Fix

Added synchronization logic in the tool switching effect (lines 871-883):

```javascript
// Sync resize tool state with current selection
if (selectedTool === TOOLS.RESIZE && selectedObjectId) {
  // When switching to Resize tool, sync resizeSelectedId with selectedObjectId
  setResizeSelectedId(selectedObjectId);
  console.log('Resize tool: Synced resizeSelectedId with selection:', selectedObjectId);
}

// Sync move tool state with current selection
if (selectedTool === TOOLS.MOVE && selectedObjectId) {
  // When switching to Move tool, sync moveSelectedId with selectedObjectId
  setMoveSelectedId(selectedObjectId);
  console.log('Move tool: Synced moveSelectedId with selection:', selectedObjectId);
}
```

### How It Works Now:

```javascript
// Step 1-4: Same as before...

// Step 5: Select yellow star
selectedObjectId = 'yellow-star-id'  // Updated

// Step 6: Switch to Resize Tool
// üîß NEW SYNC LOGIC TRIGGERS
if (selectedTool === TOOLS.RESIZE && selectedObjectId) {
  setResizeSelectedId('yellow-star-id')  // Synced! ‚úÖ
}

// Result: Handles appear on yellow star (correct!)
```

## Why This Also Fixed Move Tool

The same issue existed for Move Tool! Added the same sync logic to prevent:
- Moving one object
- Selecting a different object
- Switching to Move Tool
- Wrong object being ready to move

## Technical Details

### Tool State Management Pattern

Each manipulation tool has its own internal selection state:
- **Select Tool**: Updates `selectedObjectId` (global)
- **Move Tool**: Uses `moveSelectedId` (local to tool)
- **Resize Tool**: Uses `resizeSelectedId` (local to tool)

This separation exists because:
1. Tools need to track their own operations independently
2. Different tools have different state requirements
3. Tool switching should preserve the global selection

### Why Manual Sync Is Needed

React doesn't automatically sync derived states. When you switch tools:
- `selectedTool` changes (trigger)
- `selectedObjectId` might change (from Select Tool)
- Tool-specific IDs DON'T automatically update

The `useEffect` with `[selectedTool, selectedObjectId]` dependencies watches for tool switches and syncs the states.

## Location in Code

**File**: `/src/components/canvas/Canvas.jsx`
**Lines**: 871-883 (new sync logic)
**Effect**: Lines 856-891 (complete tool switching effect)

## Testing Verification

‚úÖ **No linter errors**  
‚úÖ **Canvas renders correctly**  
‚úÖ **Hot reload successful**  
‚úÖ **Sync logic logs to console**  

### Manual Testing Steps:

1. **Test Star Resize Sync:**
   - Select star A with Select Tool
   - Switch to Resize Tool ‚Üí Handles should appear on star A ‚úÖ
   - Resize star A
   - Switch to Select Tool
   - Select star B
   - Switch to Resize Tool ‚Üí Handles should appear on star B (not star A!) ‚úÖ

2. **Test Move Sync:**
   - Select object A
   - Switch to Move Tool
   - Move object A
   - Switch to Select Tool
   - Select object B
   - Switch to Move Tool ‚Üí Should be ready to move object B (not object A!)

3. **Test Multiple Tool Switches:**
   - Select object
   - Switch Resize ‚Üí Move ‚Üí Resize ‚Üí Select ‚Üí Resize
   - Handles should always appear on currently selected object

## Edge Cases Handled

‚úÖ **No object selected**: Sync only runs when `selectedObjectId` exists  
‚úÖ **Tool-specific state cleared**: Shape creation tools clear all manipulation states  
‚úÖ **Pan tool**: Doesn't interfere with selection states  
‚úÖ **Keyboard shortcuts**: Sync works with hotkey tool switching  

## Impact

**User Experience**: 
- Resize handles now ALWAYS appear on the selected object
- No more visual confusion
- Predictable behavior when switching tools
- Consistent with user expectations

**Code Quality**:
- Explicit state synchronization
- Clear console logging for debugging
- Follows existing pattern
- Self-documenting with comments

## Related Issues

This same pattern could be applied to other tools if they develop similar state sync issues:
- Text tool (if implemented)
- Rotation tool (if implemented)
- Any future manipulation tools

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ Handles appear on correct object when switching to Resize Tool  
‚úÖ Move Tool targets correct object when switching tools  
‚úÖ No visual desynchronization between selection and tool states  
‚úÖ Console logs confirm sync operations  
‚úÖ User can rapidly switch tools without confusion  

## Conclusion

The fix ensures that when you switch to Resize or Move tools, they immediately sync their internal selection state with the global selection. This eliminates visual bugs where handles or manipulation indicators appear on the wrong object. The solution is simple, performant, and follows React best practices for derived state management.
