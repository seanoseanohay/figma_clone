# Bugs Fixed Summary

## All Bugs Resolved ✅

### Bug #1: Hooks referencing removed `projectId`
**Issue**: `useCursorTracking.js` and `usePresence.js` were trying to destructure `projectId` from `useCanvas()`, but I had removed it from `CanvasContext`.

**Fix**:
- Updated `useCursorTracking.js` to use only `canvasId`
- Updated `usePresence.js` to use only `canvasId`
- Updated all presence service calls to pass only `canvasId` parameter
- Removed all `projectId` references from hooks

**Files Modified**:
- `src/hooks/useCursorTracking.js`
- `src/hooks/usePresence.js`

### Bug #2: Missing `lucide-react` package
**Issue**: New components (`CanvasSelector`, `InviteButton`, `InviteModal`, `EmptyState`) were importing from `lucide-react` but the package wasn't installed, causing 500 errors.

**Fix**:
- Installed `lucide-react` package: `npm install lucide-react`
- Restarted Vite dev server to pick up new package

**Command Run**:
```bash
npm install lucide-react
```

### Bug #3: Export/Import mismatch
**Issue**: New components were using named exports (`export const Component`) but being imported as default imports.

**Fix**:
- Changed all new components to use default exports
- Updated all import statements to use default imports

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/canvas/CanvasSelector.jsx` - Changed to default export
- `src/components/canvas/InviteButton.jsx` - Changed to default export  
- `src/components/canvas/InviteModal.jsx` - Changed to default export
- `src/components/canvas/EmptyState.jsx` - Changed to default export
- `src/components/layout/Header.jsx` - Updated imports
- `src/components/canvas/Toolbar.jsx` - Updated imports
- `src/components/canvas/Canvas.jsx` - Updated imports

### Bug #4: Old `ProjectDashboard` still imported
**Issue**: `Canvas.jsx` was still importing and using `ProjectDashboard` which depends on the old `useProjects` hook that references the removed `getCanvasesForProject` function.

**Fix**:
- Removed `ProjectDashboard` import from `Canvas.jsx`
- Removed unreachable code that returned `ProjectDashboard`
- `EmptyState` component now handles the "no canvas" case

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/canvas/Canvas.jsx`

## Verification Results

### ✅ App Successfully Loads
- Login page renders correctly
- No console errors (only minor autocomplete warning which is not a bug)
- All components load without 500 errors
- Vite dev server running smoothly

### ✅ No Linter Errors
All modified files pass linting with zero errors.

### Files That Still Exist But Are Unused (Safe to Delete Later)
- `src/hooks/useProjects.js` - No longer imported anywhere
- `src/components/project/ProjectCanvasSelector.jsx` - Replaced by `CanvasSelector`
- `src/components/dashboard/ProjectDashboard.jsx` - No longer used

## Testing Status

### ✅ Completed
- App loads successfully
- No console errors
- No import/export errors
- No missing dependencies

### Still To Test (Before Final Deployment)
- Canvas creation flow
- Canvas selection from dropdown
- Invite system (existing users)
- Invite system (non-registered users)
- Multi-user collaboration
- Cursor tracking
- Canvas deletion
- Pending invite processing on login

## Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

1. ✅ Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install react-toastify lucide-react
   ```

2. ⏳ Deploy Firebase security rules
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,database
   ```

3. ⏳ Test all major flows with real Firebase

4. ⏳ Clean up unused files (optional)

## Summary

**Total Bugs Fixed**: 4 critical bugs

All blocking bugs have been resolved. The application now:
- Uses canvas-only architecture correctly
- Has all required dependencies installed
- Has consistent exports/imports
- Has no circular or missing dependencies
- Loads without errors

The app is now ready for functional testing of the new features!
